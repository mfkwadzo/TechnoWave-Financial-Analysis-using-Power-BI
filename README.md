# TechnoWave-Financial-Analysis-using-Power-BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of key business performance metrics, enabling CFO and CMO to make data-driven decisions and identify areas of growth and optimization.
 
## Problem Statement
Technowave seeks to better understand its financial performance across key metrics, including sales, profit, and profit margins, while identifying areas of improvement. Specifically, the project seeks to answer:
•	What are the trends in sales, profit, and profit margins over time?

•	Which regions, segments, and products are driving or hindering performance?

•	How do discount strategies impact profitability?

•	Where are the inefficiencies or underperforming areas?

## Data Source and Structure

The Dataset was a from the CFO of Technowave and consists of a total of 701 entries with 16 columns about product records, sales and demographics including Segment, Country, Product, Discount Band, Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Discounts Sales, COGS, Profit, Date, Month Number, Month Name and Year.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using Power BI. The following steps were taken to analyze the data.

•	Data Cleaning and Preparation with Power Query

•	Data Normalization and modelling in Power BI

•	Exploratory Data Analysis using Dax measures

•	Time Intelligence analysis was conducted to compare current year versus the previous year

•	Data Visualisation - created interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present the findings and insights. These dashboards made it easier to communicate the results to stakeholders and highlight key factors.

## Key Insights and Findings:

**Here are a few insights that were discovered**:

•	Sales and profit have shown strong growth (+249% and +235% increase respectively) as compared to previous year, but the profit margin has slightly declined from 14.7% to 14.1% (-3.97%).

•	France leads in orders, followed by the U.S. and Canada, while Germany underperforms.

•	Over 55% of discounts are in the high-discount band, which may be reducing profitability.

•	Channel Partners deliver the highest profit margin (73%), while Enterprise and Small Business segments face low margins with Enterprise delivering a negative margin (-3%).

•	Paseo is the top-selling product, followed by VTT and Amarilla.


## Recommendations:

•	**Optimize Discounts**: Limit high discounts and focus on medium and low-discount tiers to improve profitability.

•	**Enhance Segment Performance**: Invest in high-margin segments like Channel Partners and Midmarket while addressing inefficiencies in Enterprise and Small Business segments.

•	**Targeted Regional Strategies**: Strengthen efforts in top-performing countries like France and explore growth opportunities in underperforming regions like Germany.

•	**Boost Profit Margins**: Improve cost efficiency and streamline operations to counter the slight decline in profit margins.

•	**Promote Top Products**: Expand marketing efforts for top-performing products Paseo and VTT and drive their success in weaker regions.

•	**Leverage Seasonal Trends**: Analyze seasonal patterns to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.


**These insights and recommendations can help the organization sustain growth and improve profitability while addressing key challenges**.
